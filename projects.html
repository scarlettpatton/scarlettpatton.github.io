            <h3>Swap it Like it's Hot</h3>
            <p>App that my partner and I made for Hack WasU 2022. The app provides a comfortable user experience that enables users to swap ("sharing with a purpose") items online, promoting sustainability through decreased consumption. Our on campus SWAP Store inspired us to create this app because students can only access it for a couple hours each day, making it hard for every student to enjoy their service. This app allows students to post items online and start transactions or "swaps" through the online platform without having the store be open on campus.</p>
